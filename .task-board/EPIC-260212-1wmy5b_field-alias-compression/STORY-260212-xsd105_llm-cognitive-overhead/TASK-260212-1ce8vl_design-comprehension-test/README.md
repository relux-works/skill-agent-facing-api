# TASK-260212-1ce8vl: design-comprehension-test

## Description
Design a synthetic LLM comprehension test. Format: give Claude compact output with abbreviated headers + alias dictionary, then ask structured questions about the data (e.g. 'what is the status of item X?', 'how many items are in-progress?', 'who is assigned to Y?'). Create test sets at 3 alias complexity levels: 5 fields, 15 fields, 30 fields. Each test has 10 questions. Control group: same data with full field names, no dictionary needed.
