# TASK-260218-20g20f: research-alternative-mutation-patterns

## Description
Research mutation/write patterns beyond GraphQL: (1) CQRS command bus — command objects, handlers, validation pipeline; (2) Hasura/PostgREST/Supabase — auto-generated mutations from DB schema, insert/update/delete conventions; (3) tRPC — procedure-based mutations with typed input/output; (4) Firebase/Firestore — document mutation API; (5) Any other agent-facing CLI tools with write support. Focus on: how mutations are declared, discovered (introspection), validated, and how errors are reported. Write findings to .research/
