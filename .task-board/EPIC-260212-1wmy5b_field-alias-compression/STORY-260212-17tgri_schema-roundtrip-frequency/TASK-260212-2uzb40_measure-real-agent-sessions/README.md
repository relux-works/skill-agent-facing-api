# TASK-260212-2uzb40: measure-real-agent-sessions

## Description
Run real agent sessions against the example taskdemo CLI with abbreviated and non-abbreviated output. Give Claude a series of tasks that require querying the board (e.g. 'find all blocked tasks', 'check status of task-3', 'list tasks assigned to alice'). Track: how many times the agent calls schema() vs data queries, whether it caches the dictionary or re-queries, at what point in the session it starts making errors. Compare with control sessions using full field names. Document in .research/260212_real-session-roundtrip-analysis.md.
