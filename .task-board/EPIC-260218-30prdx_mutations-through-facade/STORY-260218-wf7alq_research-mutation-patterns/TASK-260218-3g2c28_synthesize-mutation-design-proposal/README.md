# TASK-260218-3g2c28: synthesize-mutation-design-proposal

## Description
Based on GraphQL and alternative pattern research, synthesize a design proposal for agentquery mutations. Cover: (1) DSL syntax for mutations (how agents will call them); (2) Schema registration API (how consuming CLIs declare mutations with handlers); (3) Schema introspection (how mutations appear in schema()); (4) Input validation approach; (5) Error handling and response format; (6) Interaction with existing read operations (same parser? separate command?); (7) Compact/LLM output mode for mutation responses. Produce a concrete design doc in .research/ with code sketches.
