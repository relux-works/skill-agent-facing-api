# EPIC-260218-30prdx: mutations-through-facade

## Description
Add mutation support to agentquery Schema. Mutations are write operations (create, update, delete) exposed via the same DSL facade alongside read queries. Must: (1) be describable in Schema alongside fields/operations, (2) expose to agents via schema() introspection, (3) map to handler callbacks in the consuming CLI tool. Research GraphQL mutations and similar patterns first, then design and implement.
